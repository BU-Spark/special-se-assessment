# Welcome
This will be the home of the starter code for the Spark! SE assessment start January 20th at 5 PM. At that time there will be starter code to help you get started with things. You will not have to start from scratch if you wait but are welcome to start early.

If you'd like to start in the meantime you can build the project from scratch following the requirements:

- Built using React.js >= 19 using Create React App
- Use the `--template typescript` template when you init the Create React App
- Write all code in Typescript not Javascript
- We prefer the use of [MaterialUI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started) for components but you can use whatever you like.
- Build something that resembles the example image below

Goal:

The goal is to build a portal that displays the final grades for all students in a particular class from a given semester. All the information required can be retrieved from the API. You might need to make multiple queries to retrieve all the required information. You will also need to compute the final grade using the combination of assignment grade and assignment weight.


Resources:

The API can be found here: https://dscs519-assessment-swagger.azurewebsites.net/api
You can explore the API routes using the Swagger UI(it might take ~15s to load): https://dscs519-assessment-swagger.azurewebsites.net/api/ui
